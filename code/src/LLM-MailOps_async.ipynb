    "    Request Types:\n",
    "    - Adjustment: the term \"Adjustment\" refers to any modification or correction made to the terms or conditions of a loan or credit facility. This could involve changes to the amount of the loan, interest rates, repayment schedules, or other terms that affect how the loan is structured or managed. Adjustments can occur for various reasons, and they are typically done to accommodate the borrower’s financial situation or to ensure compliance with the bank's policies and regulations.\n",
    "    - AU Transfer: AU Transfer refers to the process of transferring funds or assets related to a loan or financial transaction, typically within an Australian (AU) banking environment. The term AU Transfer may be used in several specific ways, often related to both inbound and outbound transactions. Below is an explanation of how AU Transfer might function in the banking domain, particularly in the context of lending services.\n",
    "    - Closing Notice: Closing Notice is a formal notification issued to the borrower when the loan is about to be fully paid off, settled, or when the lender is closing or concluding the loan account. This notice serves as a confirmation and summary of the loan's final status, and it typically occurs after the borrower has made the final payment or fulfilled all terms of the loan agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "                      The Closing Notice is an essential document in the life cycle of a loan because it marks the official end of the loan contract and provides clarity on the loan’s closure.(Sub Request Type: Reallocation Fees, Amendment Fees, Reallocation Principal )\n",
    "    - Commitment Change:  Commitment Change refers to a formal modification or adjustment made to the terms or conditions of a credit facility or loan agreement. These changes can occur after the initial loan approval and are typically made to better align with the borrower’s financial situation, the market environment, or the lender's internal policies. Commitment changes can affect various aspects of the loan, such as the loan amount, interest rate, repayment schedule, collateral requirements, or the overall terms of the agreement.(Sub Request Type: Cashless Roll, Decrease, Increase)\n",
    "    - Fee Payment: Fee Payment refers to the process by which a borrower pays fees associated with a loan or credit facility. These fees are typically charged by the bank for various administrative, service, or processing tasks related to the loan. Fees can be either one-time charges or recurring, and they are typically outlined in the loan agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "                   Fee Payments are an important aspect of loan servicing, as they represent additional costs beyond the principal loan amount and interest rate.(Sub Request Type: Ongoing Fee, Letter of Credit Fee)\n",
    "    - Money Movement-Inbound: Money Movement - Inbound refers to the process by which funds are received or deposited into a bank’s system, typically related to the repayment of a loan or credit facility. This movement involves incoming cash flows from the borrower or a third party, such as a guarantor, investor, or another financial institution. These funds may be used to pay down the loan balance, pay interest, or settle any associated fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "                              The Inbound Money Movement process is a key part of loan servicing and collections in commercial banking, ensuring that repayments are properly applied to the borrower’s account and that the loan balance is correctly adjusted.(Subtypes: Principal, Interest, Principal + Interest, Principal+Interest+Fee)\n",
    "    - Money Movement-Outbound: Money Movement - Outbound refers to the process by which funds are disbursed or transferred out of the bank to the borrower or a third party. It generally refers to the flow of money from the bank to a borrower or recipient, either as a loan disbursement, a payment to a vendor or service provider, or a transfer related to the loan agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "                   This outbound movement of funds is an essential part of the lending process, as it represents the fulfillment of the bank’s obligation to provide the agreed-upon funds to the borrower or other stakeholders. (Subtypes: Timebound, Foreign Currency)\n",
