## üéØ Introduction
Many organizations receive numerous emails daily, and manually sorting and categorizing them can be time-consuming and error-prone.
LLM-MailOps aims to automate email classification and data extraction using GEN AI (LLMs), improving efficiency, accuracy and turnaround time. 
Also, minimizing the gate keeping activities.

## üí° Inspiration
This project is inspired by the need to automate the processing and classification of large volumes of emails. Many organizations handle a high volume of emails daily, and manually sorting and categorizing them can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. By utilizing AI, this project seeks to streamline the process, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does
This solution utilizes a Python program powered by the ChatGPT LLM model, which is based on predefined prompts. It reads the contents of emails and attachments, comprehends the context within the lending domain, and uses this understanding to classify emails. Additionally, it extracts key data attributes from both the emails and their attachments.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

We built this solution using a combination of **Python**, **ChatGPT**, and several **open-source packages** to handle email and file processing effectively. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the components involved in building the solution:

1. **Python as the Core Programming Language**:
   - We chose **Python** as the primary language because of its simplicity, flexibility, and vast ecosystem of libraries for data processing, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
   - Python allows for easy integration with external APIs (such as ChatGPT) and provides efficient ways to handle files, such as emails and attachments.

2. **ChatGPT for Natural Language Understanding**:
   - The heart of our email classification and data extraction lies in **ChatGPT**, a state-of-the-art language model. By using **predefined prompts**, we enable ChatGPT to understand and classify emails based on their content in the **lending domain**.
   - ChatGPT helps in interpreting the context of emails, distinguishing between different types of requests, and understanding the nuances of the lending process.
   - The model‚Äôs capability allows it to generate meaningful classifications and extract key information, such as loan requests, payment inquiries, or other relevant details.

3. **Open-Source Packages for File Processing**:
   - To handle different types of attachments and email formats, we integrated **several open-source libraries** into the system, including:
   
     - **`email` library**: Used for parsing `.eml` files to extract email headers, bodies, and attachments.
     - **`PyPDF2` and `pdfplumber`**: These packages allow us to extract text from PDF files that are often attached to emails, such as loan documents, contracts, or invoices.
     - **`python-docx`**: Used for processing `.docx` files and extracting text from Word documents attached to emails.
     - **`Pytesseract` (OCR)**: For extracting text from image files (e.g., JPEG or PNG) that may be attached to the emails, enabling the processing of scanned documents or screenshots.
   
   These open-source tools help us ensure that no matter the format of the email or attachment, we can extract and process the relevant information accurately.

4. **Predefined Prompts for Classification**:
   - We developed a set of **predefined prompts** that guide **ChatGPT** to understand and classify email content based on the lending domain context. These prompts ensure that the model focuses on the specific areas of interest, such as loan inquiries, payments, account details, or other types of financial requests.
   - The classification process involves identifying the type of request (e.g., loan application, payment dispute) and categorizing emails into sub-request types, making it easier to route them to the appropriate departments.

5. **Integration and Workflow**:
   - Once the email content and attachments are extracted, the processed data is passed through the **ChatGPT model** to classify the email.
   - The classification results are then used to extract **key data attributes**, such as customer names, loan amounts, dates, or other relevant financial data from the email and its attachments.
   - The system automatically organizes the emails into predefined categories, ensuring that important requests are handled promptly and accurately.

6. **Automation and Efficiency**:
   - By combining Python‚Äôs file handling capabilities with the power of **ChatGPT** and **open-source packages**, we built a fully automated email classification system.
   - The system not only classifies emails but also extracts critical data, reducing manual effort, increasing accuracy, and accelerating response times, especially in environments with high volumes of emails like commercial lending.

Through the use of **Python**, **ChatGPT**, and various open-source libraries, we‚Äôve created a powerful and scalable solution that automates the email classification process in the **lending domain**, streamlining workflows and enhancing overall efficiency.

## üöß Challenges We Faced
Implementing an effective email classification system using Large Language Models (LLMs) comes with several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure accurate and efficient processing. Below are some of the key challenges faced during the development and how they were tackled:

1. **Identifying a Model That Classifies Requests Consistently**
Challenge: Identifying a model capable of consistently classifying requests across a wide range of email content was a major challenge. LLMs, such as ChatGPT, require carefully crafted prompts to understand the problem context in a generic yet business-specific manner.

Solution: We explored multiple predefined prompts to guide the model in classifying email content accurately. The prompts were tailored to suit the lending domain while keeping the language generic enough to handle various types of email requests. This iterative process of prompt fine-tuning ensured that the model understood and classified the requests correctly across different scenarios.

2. **Handling Vague or Ambiguous Emails**
Challenge: Many emails we processed were not straightforward, and users often expressed their requests in vague or unclear ways. For instance, an email might mention a general inquiry about "loan status" without providing enough context.

Solution: LLMs helped in understanding user intent and the underlying service request even when the email content was not clear. The language model was able to infer the correct request type (e.g., loan inquiry, payment dispute) based on subtle clues in the email body. This capability made it possible to accurately classify emails with ambiguous or vague content, ensuring that requests were processed appropriately.

3. **Processing Large Files with LLMs**
Challenge: The process of extracting and classifying information from large email attachments or lengthy email threads using LLMs could be time-consuming, especially when dealing with a high volume of incoming requests.

Solution: To address the performance bottleneck caused by large file processing, we adopted asynchronous processing. This approach enabled the system to process incoming email requests in parallel, significantly improving the throughput and reducing the overall time taken for processing. Asynchronous processing allowed us to handle multiple emails and attachments concurrently without causing delays in response time.

4. **Dealing with Duplicate Email Requests**
Challenge: Email requests from users often contained duplicate or repeated submissions. This redundancy could lead to unnecessary processing and potential confusion.

Solution: To prevent redundant processing and ensure that each unique request is handled efficiently, we implemented a duplicate request detection mechanism. The system checks incoming emails against previously processed requests, identifying duplicates based on key metadata (such as subject, timestamp, and user details). Duplicates are filtered out before processing, ensuring that each request is handled only once and reducing unnecessary load on the system.

5. **Continuous Model Improvement and Fine-Tuning**
Challenge: The model's ability to classify emails accurately depends on continuous improvement and fine-tuning, as the nature of email requests can evolve over time.

Solution: We have developed a feedback loop where the system learns from user interactions and manual corrections to refine its classification accuracy. By periodically retraining the model with new email samples and updated data, we ensure the system remains effective and accurate in handling various types of email requests.
