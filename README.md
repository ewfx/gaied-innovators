## 🎯 Introduction
Many organizations receive numerous emails daily, and manually sorting and categorizing them can be time-consuming and error-prone.
LLM-MailOps aims to automate email classification and data extraction using GEN AI (LLMs), improving efficiency, accuracy and turnaround time. 
Also, minimizing the gate keeping activities.

## 💡 Inspiration
This project is inspired by the need to automate the processing and classification of large volumes of emails. Many organizations handle a high volume of emails daily, and manually sorting and categorizing them can be both time-consuming and prone to errors. By utilizing AI, this project seeks to streamline the process, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy.

## ⚙️ What It Does
This solution utilizes a Python program powered by the ChatGPT LLM model, which is based on predefined prompts. It reads the contents of emails and attachments, comprehends the context within the lending domain, and uses this understanding to classify emails. Additionally, it extracts key data attributes from both the emails and their attachments.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
### **How We Built It**

We built this solution using a combination of **Python**, **ChatGPT**, and several **open-source packages** to handle email and file processing effectively. Here’s a breakdown of the components involved in building the solution:

1. **Python as the Core Programming Language**:
   - We chose **Python** as the primary language because of its simplicity, flexibility, and vast ecosystem of libraries for data processing, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP).
   - Python allows for easy integration with external APIs (such as ChatGPT) and provides efficient ways to handle files, such as emails and attachments.

2. **ChatGPT for Natural Language Understanding**:
   - The heart of our email classification and data extraction lies in **ChatGPT**, a state-of-the-art language model. By using **predefined prompts**, we enable ChatGPT to understand and classify emails based on their content in the **lending domain**.
   - ChatGPT helps in interpreting the context of emails, distinguishing between different types of requests, and understanding the nuances of the lending process.
   - The model’s capability allows it to generate meaningful classifications and extract key information, such as loan requests, payment inquiries, or other relevant details.

3. **Open-Source Packages for File Processing**:
   - To handle different types of attachments and email formats, we integrated **several open-source libraries** into the system, including:
   
     - **`email` library**: Used for parsing `.eml` files to extract email headers, bodies, and attachments.
     - **`PyPDF2` and `pdfplumber`**: These packages allow us to extract text from PDF files that are often attached to emails, such as loan documents, contracts, or invoices.
     - **`python-docx`**: Used for processing `.docx` files and extracting text from Word documents attached to emails.
     - **`Pytesseract` (OCR)**: For extracting text from image files (e.g., JPEG or PNG) that may be attached to the emails, enabling the processing of scanned documents or screenshots.
   
   These open-source tools help us ensure that no matter the format of the email or attachment, we can extract and process the relevant information accurately.

4. **Predefined Prompts for Classification**:
   - We developed a set of **predefined prompts** that guide **ChatGPT** to understand and classify email content based on the lending domain context. These prompts ensure that the model focuses on the specific areas of interest, such as loan inquiries, payments, account details, or other types of financial requests.
   - The classification process involves identifying the type of request (e.g., loan application, payment dispute) and categorizing emails into sub-request types, making it easier to route them to the appropriate departments.

5. **Integration and Workflow**:
   - Once the email content and attachments are extracted, the processed data is passed through the **ChatGPT model** to classify the email.
   - The classification results are then used to extract **key data attributes**, such as customer names, loan amounts, dates, or other relevant financial data from the email and its attachments.
   - The system automatically organizes the emails into predefined categories, ensuring that important requests are handled promptly and accurately.

6. **Automation and Efficiency**:
   - By combining Python’s file handling capabilities with the power of **ChatGPT** and **open-source packages**, we built a fully automated email classification system.
   - The system not only classifies emails but also extracts critical data, reducing manual effort, increasing accuracy, and accelerating response times, especially in environments with high volumes of emails like commercial lending.

Through the use of **Python**, **ChatGPT**, and various open-source libraries, we’ve created a powerful and scalable solution that automates the email classification process in the **lending domain**, streamlining workflows and enhancing overall efficiency.
